## What's This?

This is a base template for a NextJS project which implements all the good stuff like...

- husky with lint-staged to lint/prettier on stage and test on push
- eslint & prettier
- jest & react-testing-library

## How Do I?

You can [levearge create-react-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) so it's a simple case of running this line in your terminal...

```
npx create-next-app --typescript --example https://github.com/thecodesmithy/templates-nextjs
```
